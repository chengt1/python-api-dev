## What is it

This project was made by following the tutorial posted on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA&t). The video was posted on the channel freeCodeCamp.org but made by Sanjeev Thiyagarajan.

The course is 20 hours long and covers a wide variety of tools that are helpful for beginners in API design.

I chose to finish this video since I was revamping a legacy API at work and wanted to see how I can make it even better.

### How I did it

I watched the video in 1.5 speed as I was familiar with the language.
